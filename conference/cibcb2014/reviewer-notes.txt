Abstract


    Section I.

    In introduction part, there is need for background information to understand
    the need for the research, research problem, research questions or hypotheses,
    Explanation of a gap or lack of research in the field that makes this paper
    necessary, purpose of the paper or proposal contained in the paper are not well
    defined.

    
     Preferably, the initial stage of article, author should describe the
    background knowledge rather than goal and target of paper.

    Section III.

    How much convergence percentage is reached for adding the new individuals to
    the population?
    
    

    Some paragraph have missing information regarding the application of GA or RGA
    or RRGA technique, Which one is highly effective, author should elaborate it
    further.


    To justify your claim and statement, author should use more references.
    Currently, references for supporting the author claim and statement is weak.


Reviewer 2

The paper presents an approach using evolutionary algorithms to better predict
the structure of metal protein complexes from EXAFS. The work used a variation
of genetic algorithm called RGA and used PSO in post optimization.
The work is presented very well.

An observed deficiency is that the work doesn't present a processing time
evaluation.

In the last paragraph it says that it is significantly high.

The work should contain such evaluation using different test cases. It would be
better to compare different approaches.

Minor points:

3.Section III.A would better include a paragraph introducing PSO and DE.
