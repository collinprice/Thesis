Experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra carry information about the chemical structure of metal protein complexes. However, predicting the structure of such complexes from EXAFS spectra is not a simple task. Currently methods such as Monte Carlo Optimization or simulated annealing are used in structure refinement of EXAFS. These methods have proved somewhat successful in structure refinement but have not been successful in finding the global minima. Evolutionary algorithms have had success in overcoming local minima issues in other domains. We propose the use of three different approaches to better predict the structure of metal protein complexes: genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE).
