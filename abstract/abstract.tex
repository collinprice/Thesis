\begin{abstract}

Experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure(EXAFS) spectra carry information about the chemical structure of metal protein complexes. However, predicting the structure of such complexes from EXAFS spectra is not a simple task. Currently methods such as Monte Carlo Optimization or simulated annealing are used in structure refinement of EXAFS. These methods have shown some success in structure refinement but have trouble finding the global minima. Going off the success of evolutionary algorithms to overcome local minima issues in other domains, we propose an approach using genetic algorithms to predict the  structure of metal protein complexes.
